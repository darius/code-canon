# code-canon

You've probably seen calls for recommendations for good code to read
and study. When this comes up on aggregators and stackoveflow, the
result is pretty scattershot. Here is my own list, with only code I've
read enough of to judge as interesting in some way.

Canonizing my personal recommendations is a little fraught, since I
know some of the authors and potential authors. Don't take an omission
as much of a signal; we all have finite time, biases, and different
goals and tastes.

Hopefully I'll add critical remarks, though I'm lazy.
